modified from the original code because you dont need to replace "<" and ">" unless youre showing the data on an html page, in which case, it is very important that you do
else someone could upload "<script>alert("gamig");</script>" and have it run 

kept as a reminder in case we want to make site to show off data



// endpoint to add a dream to the database
app.post("/addDream", (request, response) => {
  console.log(`add to dreams ${request.body.dream}`);

  // DISALLOW_WRITE is an ENV variable that gets reset for new projects
  // so they can write to the database
  if (!process.env.DISALLOW_WRITE) {
    const cleansedDream = cleanseString(request.body.dream);
    db.run(`INSERT INTO Dreams (dream) VALUES (?)`, cleansedDream, error => {
      if (error) {
        response.send({ message: "error!" });
      } else {
        response.send({ message: "success" });
      }
    });
  }
});

// endpoint to clear dreams from the database







// helper function that prevents html/css/script malice
const cleanseString = function(string) {
  return string.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
};
